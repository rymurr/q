## MISC ##

This project was originally a fork of Dan Nugets q library (http://github.com/nugend/q) which was a rewrite of Matt Warren's qPy (http://bitbucket.org/halotis/qpy) library. The current incarnation of this code has nothing in common with either project but the original authors still deserve credit. The main changes are to make the q connection wrapper more compliant with DB-API 2.0 and to try and hide some of the scary k/q stuff. There is also a much more pythonic and performant serializer/deserializer.
