## MISC ##

This project began as an overhaul of Matt Warren's qPy (http://bitbucket.org/halotis/qpy) library but mutated significantly in the course of the changes that were made to it. I currently do not believe that there is much of any of the code remaining from qPy, but I feel that Matt should be given credit for providing a basis to start from. This fork of Daniel Nugent's codebase is a mostly cosmetic cleanup of his work and the credit belongs to him. The main changes are to make the q connection wrapper more compliant with DB-API 2.0 and to try and hide some of the scary k/q stuff.
